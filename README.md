🎥 Movie Data Analysis — Power BI Dashboard

This project showcases an interactive Power BI dashboard I created to analyse movie performance across various dimensions such as genre, lead studio, audience reception, profitability, and worldwide gross.

It demonstrates my ability to prepare data, design data models, and build insightful, interactive reports in Power BI.

Here’s how I executed this analysis in Power BI:

Imported the movie_data.csv file and modelled the data

Cleaned fields and ensured correct data types (numeric, text, percentage)

Built calculated fields and measures (for sums and averages)

Designed individual visuals to highlight different performance metrics

Combined them into a single interactive dashboard with KPIs, charts, and tables

💡 Insights
